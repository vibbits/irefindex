Usage: $PROGNAME --show-types | ( [ --include-gzip-files ] <archive filename>... )

This scripts accepts archive filenames and unpacks each archive into the
directory in which it currently resides. If the list of archive files is
specified as - then the script tries to read archive filenames from standard
input until an end-of-file condition occurs.

If --include-gzip-files is specified, uncompress .gz files that do not appear to
be archives.
