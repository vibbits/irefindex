Usage: $PROGNAME [ --show-location | --check ] [ -v | --verbose ] ( --all | <source>... )

Download data from the different sources, or if the --check option is specified
check whether a download needs to be performed. Note that this check is only
cursory and merely looks to see if data directories are populated with suitably
named files; an actual download operation is required to test whether the files
for a data source are complete.

The sources are configured to be the following when --all is specified:

$ALLSOURCES

Sources that are to be excluded are defined to be the following:

$EXCLUDEDSOURCES

If --show-location is specified, the location from which data will be obtained
for a data source is shown, and the program will not perform any other
operation.
